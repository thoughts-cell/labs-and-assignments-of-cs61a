This repository contains my completed assignments, labs, and projects for **UC Berkeley's CS61A**. The course focuses on managing complexity in computer programs through abstraction, recursion, and multiple programming paradigms.

##  Overview
The course covers three major programming languages:
* **Python:** Main language for data abstraction and OOP.
* **Scheme:** A Lisp dialect used to explore functional programming and interpreters.
* **SQL:** Used for declarative programming and data management.
